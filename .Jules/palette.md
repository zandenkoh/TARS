## 2024-05-18 - [Accessibility: Forms and Modals]
**Learning:** Found multiple inputs, buttons, and textareas lacking basic ARIA labels and explicit label associations in `TARS/webui/templates/index.html`. While screen readers can sometimes guess context, explicit labels (`aria-label` or `for`/`id` combinations) are crucial for guaranteed accessibility.
**Action:** When creating new interactive elements, immediately add semantic labeling. Ensure SVGs inside buttons have `aria-hidden="true"` to prevent redundant reading.
## 2024-05-18 - [Accessibility: SVGs inside Buttons]
**Learning:** Found multiple SVGs inside navigation buttons (e.g., Workspace, Tasks, Search) that lacked `aria-hidden="true"`. Since these buttons already have visible text that conveys their meaning, screen readers will redundantly read the SVG content if it is not explicitly hidden.
**Action:** Always add `aria-hidden="true"` to decorative SVGs inside buttons that also contain text to prevent redundant screen reader announcements.
